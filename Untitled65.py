# Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?
# 

# __iter__: This method allows an object to be iterable. It should return an iterator object that defines the __next__ method, which is responsible for returning the next item in the iteration. The __iter__ method is called when you use the built-in iter() function on an object or when you use the object in a for loop.
# 
# __getitem__: This method allows you to access items in your object using the indexing operator []. By implementing __getitem__, you can make your class iterable by treating it like a sequence or a container.
#     

# Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?
# 

# __str__: This method is used to define a string representation of an object. It should return a human-readable string that represents the object's state or value. The str() built-in function and the print() function call the __str__ method to obtain a string representation of an object.
# 
# __repr__: This method is used to define a string representation that is mainly aimed at developers and debugging. It should return a string that represents the object in a way that is unambiguous and allows the object to be recreated. The repr() built-in function calls the __repr__ method to obtain a string representation of an object.
# 

# Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?
# 

# To intercept slice operations in a class, you can use the __getitem__ method with slice indexing. The __getitem__ method allows you to customize how objects of your class are accessed using indexing operations, including slice operations.

# Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?
# 

# To capture in-place addition in a class, you can use the __iadd__ method. The __iadd__ method allows you to define the behavior when the += operator is used on objects of your class. It performs the in-place addition operation and updates the object's state accordingly.

# Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?
# 

# Operator overloading is appropriate when it provides a clear and intuitive meaning for the class, enhances code readability and expressiveness, promotes code reusability, and aligns with the conventions of the programming language. It should be used judiciously, following best practices and avoiding confusion or surprises for other developers.
